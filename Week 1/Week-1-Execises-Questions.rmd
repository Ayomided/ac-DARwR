Week 1 Exercises

**Vectors**

**1. Create a vector u that has values -10, -9, -8, . . . ,0. How many
different ways can you use?**

**2. Create another vector v that has values -0.1, 0.4, 0.9, 1.4, ., and
there are 11 numbers (aka**

**terms) in v. How many different ways can you use?**

**3. Calculate the vector of u+v and u\*v.**

**4. Increase all terms in u by 1, and then take away 20% from all terms
in v.**

**5. Create a vector w that contains all the numbers from u and then v.
Report the length of**

**w.**

**6. Use a command to return the 14th, 15th and 16th value of w. What
about the 2nd, the**

**5th, 9th and 21st value of w? What is the 23rd value?**

**7. Sort w in the descending order.**

**Matrices**

**1. Create the following matrix and assign it to the variable b_matrix.
Extract a sub-matrix**

**from b_matrix named subB.**

\## a b c d e

\## A 1 3 5 7 9

\## B 11 13 15 17 19

\## C 21 23 25 27 29

\## D 31 33 35 37 39

**2.** **Create three vectors x,y,z with integers and each vector has 3
elements.** **Combine the**

**three vectors to become a** 3 *Ã—* 3 **matrix A where each column
represents a vector. Change the row names to a,b,c.**
